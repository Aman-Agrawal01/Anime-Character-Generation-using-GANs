# Introduction 
This repository contains my attempt to generate anime characters using various Generative Adversarial Networks. 
Right now, the GAN algorithms which I had used are- 

1. [DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)

# Dataset 
The dataset that I had used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces). This dataset contains 21,551 64x64 RGB images of anime characters.
